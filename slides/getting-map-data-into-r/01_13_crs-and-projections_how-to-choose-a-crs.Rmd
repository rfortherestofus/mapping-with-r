This video gets into the technical details of finding a **suitable** projected CRS.

This is only a concern for geocomputations and GIS analysis - for straightforward mapping you can use our magic CRS - 4326.

## There are no all-purpose CRS

> “There exist no all-purpose projections, all involve distortion when far from the center of the specified frame” (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez-Rubio 2013)

## National Mapping Agencies to the rescue

If your data lie within country borders then you can take advantage of CRS specifically designed by *National Mapping Agencies*.

These agencies create nation-level CRS that allow precision...

- ... national infrastructe planning.

- ... cellular network coverage.

- ... coastal erosion monitoring.

- ... weather forecasting.

- ... maps for civilian, government and military uses.

### Governments usually supply data in national CRS

GIS datasets obtained from government data portals are usually provided in the national CRS - for instance [geoportal.statistics.gov.uk](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-authority-districts-may-2020-boundaries-uk-bfe).

We can then use `st_crs()` and `st_transform()` to project other datasets into the national CRS.

```{r}
national_gis_dataset <- read_sf("data/shapefiles")
your_own_data <- read_sf("data/points")

your_own_data %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(national_gis_dataset))
```

### Hunting for national CRS

There isn't a perfect process for finding national CRS and many countries just don't have one.

The first place I recommend searching is [EPSG.io](https://epsg.io)

## UTM CRS

.pull-left[
The **U**niversal **T**ransverse **M**ercator system splits the Earth into 60 zones 
The zones are a nice balance between being large enough to be useful but small enough to reduce distortions.

## UTM CRS

.pull-left[
The UTM system does such a good job at splitting nations into usable zones that the grid includes only include two exceptions.

Zones 31 through 37 are modified to accommodate Norway's southwest border and Svalbard.

## UTM CRS

.pull-left[
Unfortunately, UTM CRS are not suitable if your data straddles multiple UTM zones.

## Oceanographic CRS

.pull-left[
There are Oceanographic CRS for entire oceans and small regions. 

Small region oceanographic CRS are usually designed for oil exploration/extraction.

I recommend using [EPSG.io](https://epsg.io) to search for appropriage CRS for your data.]

# Takeaways

.pull-left[
- You might need to dig around for an appropriate CRS.

- Use `st_crs()` to ensure `sf` datasets contain the exact same CRS.

.pull-right[
```{r}
uk_borders <- read_sf("data/uk")

uk_cities %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(uk_borders))
```
]
